# Sorting Algorithms

## What is Sorting?
Sorting ka matlab data ko kisi order me arrange karna
(ascending ya descending).

## Why Sorting is Important?
- Binary search apply karne ke liye
- Two pointer technique ke liye
- Duplicate / nearest elements find karne ke liye

## Types of Sorting
1. Comparison Based
   - Bubble, Selection, Insertion
   - Merge, Quick
2. Non-Comparison Based
   - Counting
   - Radix

## Stable vs Unstable Sorting
- Stable: Order maintain (Merge Sort)
- Unstable: Order change ho sakta hai (Quick Sort)

## In-place vs Not In-place
- In-place: O(1) extra space
- Not In-place: Extra memory use

## When to use which sort?
- Small input → Insertion Sort
- Large input → Merge / Quick
